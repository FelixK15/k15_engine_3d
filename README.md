The K15 Engine 3D is a 3D Game Engine which is currently in heavy development.
It is the successor to my 2D Game Engine the K15 Engine.

The engine is in development since late 2002 and has been refactored several times since then as this is a project I work on in my spare time to test various techniques related with game and engine design.

### Features ###

Currently the engine supports the following features:
* Runs on Windows, Linux and Android
* Plugin based architecture to keep the engine core as light as possible
* Component based game object system
* Easy to use code reflection system (WIP)
* Serialization (works together with the reflection system)
* Custom RTTI system
* Light core, doesn't depend on 'big' libraries like SDL or Qt for multiplatform features
